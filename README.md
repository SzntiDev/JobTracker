> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Platform Specificity**: Currently, JobTracker is exclusively designed and optimized for **Computrabajo**. Support for other platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed is not yet implemented.

**JobTracker** is a powerful automation tool designed to extract, process, and analyze job postings from Computrabajo at scale. By combining high-speed web scraping with the analytical capabilities of **Llama 3.3 (via Groq API)**, it transforms raw job descriptions into actionable market insights.

It provides a seamless workflow from automated data collection to professional strategic summaries.

## ✨ Features

- 🕷️ **Deep Scraper Logic**: Unlike basic scrapers, JobTracker visits each individual job link to extract full descriptions, salary info, and specific requirements.
- 🤖 **AI Intelligence**: Integrated with **Groq (Llama-3.3-70b)** to identify top technical skills, experience levels, and strategic advice for candidates.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous Core**: Built on **Playwright**, allowing for fast and reliable navigation through dozens of pages and dynamic content.
- 🔑 **Portable Security**: Uses encrypted `.env` management to keep API keys safe and private, with an automated fallback to manual input for new users.
- 🎨 **CLI Aesthetics**: Features a custom ASCII-art terminal interface with UTF-8 support for a premium developer experience.
- 📂 **Structured Data Export**: Automatically generates detailed CSV files (`utf-8-sig`) for further analysis or spreadsheet management.

## 🚀 How It Works

JobTracker follows a dual-phase execution pipeline to ensure data quality and intelligence.

### 1. Extraction Engine (Deep Scraping)
The scraper uses **Playwright** to navigate multiple result pages. For each job found, it performs a second-pass navigation to the detail URL. Instead of relying on fragile CSS selectors, it employs a robust `inner_text` extraction of the `.box_detail` container, capturing 100% of the visible information (requirements, benefits, full text) even if the platform layout changes slightly.

### 2. Analytical Processor (Groq / Llama 3.3)
The analytical module consumes the generated CSV. To prevent token overflow while maintaining the highest precision, it implements a smart truncation algorithm. It sends this condensed high-value context to **Llama 3.3**, which extracts patterns that a human would take hours to identify.
